# Health & Safety Database Setup

## Overview
The Health & Safety module has been successfully connected to the database with full CRUD functionality for managing workplace incidents.

## Database Schema

### Table: `health_safety_incidents`
```sql
CREATE TABLE health_safety_incidents (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  site_id BIGINT REFERENCES sites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  incident_date DATE NOT NULL,
  reported_by_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  investigation_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'open' CHECK (investigation_status IN ('open', 'in_progress', 'closed')),
  report_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Features
- **Primary Key**: Auto-incrementing ID
- **Foreign Keys**: Links to sites table and auth.users table
- **Status Tracking**: Three status levels (open, in_progress, closed)
- **Timestamps**: Automatic created_at and updated_at tracking
- **File Support**: Optional report_url field for file attachments

## Database Setup Files

### 1. `create-health-safety-incidents-table.sql`
Contains the complete SQL schema with:
- Table creation
- Indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates

### 2. `src/lib/healthSafetyService.js`
Centralized service for all database operations:
- `getIncidents()` - Fetch all incidents with site data
- `getSites()` - Fetch sites for dropdown
- `createIncident()` - Create new incident
- `updateIncident()` - Update existing incident
- `updateIncidentStatus()` - Change investigation status
- `deleteIncident()` - Remove incident
- `getIncidentStats()` - Get statistics
- `searchIncidents()` - Search functionality

### 3. `src/pages/HealthSafety.jsx`
Updated React component that:
- Uses the centralized service
- Provides full CRUD interface
- Includes search functionality
- Shows incident status management
- Handles file uploads (UI ready)

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Enabled on the `health_safety_incidents` table
- Policies allow authenticated users to:
  - Read all incidents
  - Insert new incidents
  - Update existing incidents
  - Delete incidents

### Data Validation
- Required fields: site_id, description, incident_date
- Status validation: Only 'open', 'in_progress', 'closed' allowed
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

## Testing

### Setup Scripts
1. `setup-health-safety.js` - Creates table and tests connection
2. `test-health-safety.js` - Comprehensive functionality testing

### Test Results
âœ… Database connection working  
âœ… Tables accessible  
âœ… Joins working  
âœ… RLS policies active  
âœ… Sites table has data (2 sites found)  

## Usage

### Creating Incidents
1. Navigate to Health & Safety page
2. Click "Report New Incident"
3. Fill in required fields:
   - Site selection
   - Incident date
   - Description
   - Optional file upload
4. Submit form

### Managing Incidents
- **View**: All incidents displayed in table format
- **Edit**: Click edit button to modify incident details
- **Status Updates**: Use action buttons to change investigation status
- **Search**: Filter incidents by site, description, or reporter

### Status Workflow
1. **Open** â†’ New incidents start here
2. **In Progress** â†’ Investigation underway
3. **Closed** â†’ Investigation complete

## Integration Points

### Sites Table
- Incidents are linked to sites via `site_id`
- Site names displayed in incident list
- Site selection required for new incidents

### Authentication
- Uses Supabase auth for user management
- `reported_by_id` links to authenticated user
- RLS policies ensure proper access control

## File Upload Support
- UI ready for file uploads
- `report_url` field available for storing file references
- File upload functionality can be implemented as needed

## Performance Optimizations
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Efficient joins with sites table
- Pagination support ready
- Search optimization with ILIKE queries

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Database schema created
2. âœ… Service layer implemented
3. âœ… UI connected to database
4. âœ… Testing completed
5. ðŸ”„ File upload implementation (optional)
6. ðŸ”„ User profile integration (optional)
7. ðŸ”„ Advanced reporting features (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **RLS Policy Errors**: Ensure user is authenticated
2. **Foreign Key Errors**: Verify sites table has data
3. **Join Errors**: Check table relationships exist

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test database setup
node setup-health-safety.js

# Test functionality
node test-health-safety.js
```
